      <h3>Workshop topic</h3>
      <p>Understanding the ontological nature of social, legal and economic concepts and institutions is crucial for providing principled modelling in many important domains such as enterprise modelling, business processes, and social ontology. A significant number of fundamental concepts that are ubiquitous in economics, social, and legal sciences - such as value, risk, capability, good, service, exchange, transaction, competition, social norm, group, institution - have only recently been approached from a specifically ontological perspective. 
It is therefore important to offer a venue to gather the recent contributions to this topic. The workshop encourages submissions on both theoretical and methodological issues in the use of ontologies for modelling social, legal and economic concepts and institutions, as well as submissions on concrete use of ontologies in application for these domains. SoLEE 2020 is a follow-up to SoLEE 2019 (https://solee-2020.github.io), which in turn was related to two other previous events (SoLE-BD and Ontology of Economics 2018). </p>      
      <h3>Goals of the Workshop</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>to collect approaches to deal with social, legal and economic entities in foundational and applied ontologies and</li>
        <li>discuss applications of these approaches to social, legal and economic entities in ontologies for biomedicine and business informatics,</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The workshop is intended to serve as a meeting point for stakeholders from applied ontology and the respective domain disciplines. The goals of the workshop are to collect approaches to deal with social, legal and economic entities in foundational and applied ontologies and to discuss applications of these approaches to social, legal and economic entities in ontologies for biomedicine and business informatics. </p>
      <h3>Topics of interest include but are not restricted to:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ontology of social, legal, and economic concepts - e.g., groups, norms, cooperation, competition, economic and legal agent, utility, money, risk, rationality, market, etc.</li>
        <li>Extensions of foundational ontologies to include social, legal, and economic institutions.</li>
        <li>Knowledge representation involving social, legal and economic entities. </li>
        <li>Methodological issues in representing social legal, and economic concepts.</li>
        <li>Formal languages for economics, logics for modelling economic, social and legal concepts.</li>
        <li>Social and legal norms - in social, legal and economic environments.</li>
        <li>Social, legal and economic roles and responsibilities of/within collective entities like organisations, companies, enterprises, social groups, customers, corporate agents, institutions.</li>
        <li>Decision procedures in groups, organisations and institutions.</li>
        <li>Value, value ascription, value production, value (co-)creation.</li>

      <h3>On JOWO</h3>
      <p>The Joint Ontology WOrkshops (JOWO) is a venue of workshops that, together, address a wide spectrum of topics related to ontology research, ranging from Cognitive Science to Knowledge Representation, Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Logic, Philosophy, and Linguistics.</p>
      <p>This year, JOWO will host the satellite workshops of the International Conference on Formal Ontology in Information Systems (FOIS), and both FOIS and JOWO are organised under the auspices of the Bolzano Summer of Knowledge (BOKS).
